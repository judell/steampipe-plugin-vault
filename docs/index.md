# Hashicorp Vault + Turbot Steampipe

[Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) is an industry-leading Secrets Management & Data Protection solution from [Hashicorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/).

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io/) is an open source CLI for querying cloud APIs using SQL from [Turbot](https://turbot.com/)

## Getting Started

### Installation

Download and install the latest Vault plugin:

```shell
steampipe plugin install theapsgroup/vault
```

### Prerequisites

- Vault Server
- Vault API Token

### Configuration

The preferred option is to use Environment Variables for configuration as the Vault Token should be rotated frequently, however you can configure in the `~./steampipe/config/vault.spc` (this will take precedence).

Environment Variables (default from Hashicorp Vault):

- `VAULT_ADDR` for the server address (ex: `https://vault.mycorp.com/`)
- `VAULT_TOKEN` for the API token (ex: `s.f7Ea3C3ojOYE0GRLzmhSGNkE`)

Configuration File:

```hcl
connection "vault" {
  plugin  = "theapsgroup/vault"
  address = "https://vault.mycorp.com/"
  token   = "s.f7Ea3C3ojOYE0GRLzmhSGNkE"
}
```
### Testing

A quick test can be performed from your terminal with:

```shell
steampipe query "select * from vault_engine"
```
